# Sailing Rules Training Preparation

## Completed Steps

1. **PDF Processing Setup**
   - Added PyPDF2 to requirements.txt
   - Implemented PDF text extraction in `load_raw_data()` method
   - Successfully processed 3 PDF files containing sailing rules:
     - 2025-2028-RRS-with-Changes-and-Corrections.pdf
     - Changes-to-the-RRS-that-Affect-Judging-effective-January-1-2025-1.pdf
     - US-Sailing-Prescriptions-for-2025-2028-10.29.2024.pdf

2. **Dataset Creation**
   - Enhanced `create_qa_pairs()` method with realistic sailing rules Q&A
   - Enhanced `create_scenario_pairs()` method with realistic sailing scenarios
   - Created a total of 51 training examples (38 rule-based + 13 scenario-based)
   - Split the dataset into train (36), validation (4), and test (11) sets
   - Dataset is saved to the path specified in config.yaml (`data/processed`)

3. **Testing**
   - Created and ran `test_dataset_processing.py` to verify dataset creation
   - Confirmed successful text extraction and dataset preparation

## Dataset Statistics

- **Total examples**: 51
- **Train set**: 36 examples
- **Validation set**: 4 examples
- **Test set**: 11 examples

## Next Steps

1. **Start Training**
   - Run the training script to fine-tune the Flan-T5 model:
     ```
     python train.py
     ```
   - This will initialize the base Flan-T5 model, apply LoRA adapters, and train on the prepared dataset
   - Training parameters are configured in `config.yaml`

2. **Evaluate the Model**
   - After training, evaluate the model using:
     ```
     python evaluate.py
     ```
   - This will provide metrics on how well the model performs on the test set

3. **Interactive Testing**
   - Test the model interactively using the Gradio app:
     ```
     python -m inference.app
     ```

## Potential Improvements

1. **Expand the Dataset**
   - Add more rule-based and scenario-based examples
   - Extract more structured information from the PDF files
   - Consider using NLP techniques to automatically generate more Q&A pairs

2. **Tune Hyperparameters**
   - Adjust learning rate, batch size, and other parameters in `config.yaml`
   - Try different LoRA configurations

3. **Model Size**
   - Consider using a larger Flan-T5 model (large or xl) for better performance

## Notes

- The current implementation uses LoRA adapters for efficient fine-tuning
- Training will save the model to the path specified in `config.yaml` (`models/sailing_rules_assistant`)
- The model is ready to be trained on the sailing rules dataset
